# -News-Text-Classification-System-using-Simple-RNN
A deep learning project that detects fake news using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. It processes text data to classify news articles as Real or Fake with high accuracy.
# Fake News Detection using RNN

This project aims to detect fake news using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. It processes textual news data to classify articles as *Real* or *Fake*.

##  Features
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text cleaning and tokenization
- RNN model built with Embedding and SimpleRNN layers
- Visualization of accuracy and loss using Matplotlib
- Achieved ~90% accuracy on test data

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Fake-News-Detection-RNN.git
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter:

jupyter notebook Fake_News_Detection_RNN.ipynb
